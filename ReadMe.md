# MixerClone

This tiny little tool simply takes the current volume settings from ONE audio device and clones it to ANOTHER audio device.

Example: You change the volume of your headset to 30% then the volume of your speakers will also go to 30%. This way you can change the volume of two devices at the same time. 

Reason why this tool exist is because the volume control on my keyboard did not change the default output device but my headset which was annoying

Donwload and run (or build yourself) and start without parameters to retrieve the list of all your devices. Add the id from your sourcedevice and it will be cloned to your default device.
